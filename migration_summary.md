# TAMS Migration Summary

## Migration Process

The TAMS project has been successfully migrated to a modular Flask application structure, following best practices for maintainability and scalability.

## Key Changes

1. **Modular Directory Structure**:
   - Organized code into logical packages (api, models, core, utils)
   - Created clear separation of concerns
   - Improved file organization

2. **Flask Application Factory Pattern**:
   - Implemented app factory in app/__init__.py
   - Improved configuration management
   - Better testing and extensibility

3. **API Versioning**:
   - All endpoints organized under /api/v1/
   - Prepared for future API versions

4. **Models Organization**:
   - Split models.py into multiple domain-specific files
   - Centralized database configuration

5. **Core Functionality**:
   - Separated predictor module
   - Centralized error handling
   - Improved browsable API
